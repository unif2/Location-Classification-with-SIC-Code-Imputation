# Location-Classification-with-SIC-Code-Imputation
### PySpark code aiming to classify cellphone location data according to which Point of Interest (POI) the user was most likely visiting.  In order to do this, I needed to impute missing Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes in the Missouri POI data set.  I used a little Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Naive Bayes classification model to do this.  I also used PySpark ML for this project since the data was distributed in a HADOOP cluster.
